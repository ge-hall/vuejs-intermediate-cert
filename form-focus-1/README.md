# Form Focus

# Challenge Description

In this challenge, let's focus the first field in our form (the name field) when it's added to the DOM and shown in the modal overlay

> ðŸ’¡ HINT: You could do this with the autofocus attribute but use a template ref instead so you can practice this valuable Vue.js concept!

## Requirements

- When the modal component opens, the name field on the movie form should be focused for the user to start filling the form
- Use a template ref in the MovieForm component to focus the input when the component mounts to the DOM

## Other Considerations

- If you see the `data-test` attribute anywhere in the boilerplate don't remove it.
- TailwindCSS is preinstalled with the default config. It might be helpful for you, if you want to have some styles. (Not obligatory)

## Example of Finished App

This is an example of what the functionality should look like for the completed exercise. If youâ€™d like to mimic this style, feel free to do so, but it is not required.
