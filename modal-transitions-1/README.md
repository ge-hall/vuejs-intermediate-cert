# Modal Transitions

# Challenge Description

In this challenge, let's make our app look a little nicer by adding some transitions to the modal component.

> ðŸ’¡ HINT: We've updated the modal overlay component so that it takes in a `show` prop instead of using v-if to show/hide it.

## Requirements

- When the modal component appears and disappears it should be done with a smooth transition.
- We want to have two different transitions
  1. the modal overlay (the dark background) should fade in
  2. the modal itself should slide in (fade in + slide down 50px)

## Other Considerations

- If you see the `data-test` attribute anywhere in the boilerplate don't remove it.
- TailwindCSS is preinstalled with the default config. It might be helpful for you, if you want to have some styles. (Not obligatory)

## Example of Finished App

This is an example of what the functionality should look like for the completed exercise. If youâ€™d like to mimic this style, feel free to do so, but it is not required.
